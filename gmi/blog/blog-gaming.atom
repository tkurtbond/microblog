&lt;h1&gt;2023-02-14 11:45:04-05:00 - Almost got to play in an OVA game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;http://consp.org/blog/2023/ova-cover.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;ova-cover.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the BESM 4E game I was playing in came to an unexpected stop, alas.  It looked like it might be replaced with OVA: The Anime Role-Playing Game, but in the end we couldn&amp;#39;t agree on an anime setting to play in, and we ended up playing Deathbringer instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dyskami.ca/besm.html&quot;&gt;BESM 4E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Eyes%2C_Small_Mouth&quot;&gt;BESM at Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wiseturtle.com/games.html&quot;&gt;OVA: The Anime Role-Playing Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/396879/Deathbringer-RPG&quot;&gt;Deathbringer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deathbringer game we played was fun, but I regret not getting to play OVA.  So now I&amp;#39;m rereading OVA and wishing I had the time and a game to play in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dynamic Powers vs. Power Flux in BESM 4E</title>

&lt;h1&gt;2023-02-07 10:20:00-05:00 - Dynamic Powers vs. Power Flux in BESM 4E&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m rereading this section in BESM 4E (pages 259–260) and think it is pretty good advice for using Dynamic Powers, Power Flux, and Power Variation.  I found the Dynamic Sorcery difficult to get my mind around in BESM 2E, and as far as I can tell there wasn&amp;#39;t equivalent advice in BESM 3E, although I think its versions of Dynamic Powers, Power Flux, and Power Variation are very similiar to those in BESM 4E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is also in Tri-Stat Core RPG (pages 157–158), as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2023-02-05 14:19:00-05:00 - Mini Six Middle Sea Game, session 7&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;http://consp.org/blog/2023/ambush-at-the-maple-tree-the-end.png&quot; alt=&quot;The End of the Ambush at the Maple Tree&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the combat {at the last session} there are 5 Sanguine Sons who are incapacitated and 3 that are paralyzed.  The PCs tie them all up and decide to interrogate them.  Ruan realizes doing it separately and out of the other Sons&amp;#39; sight and hearing will let the PCs confirm the individual stories against each other.  Ruan and Treave take the Sons, one at a time, around the tree and interrogate them.  The start with a Son who turns out to be the second in command of this ambush.  (The leader was dead.)  Initially resistant, after Ruan cuts off his finger he quickly capitulates and answers their questions.  The Sons think that the prophecy is false and the PCs interest in it is because they are working against the Sons, hence the ambush.  The Sons&amp;#39; aim is to gain enough power from possession of an artifact (perhaps the Eye of Zetha?) to take over Korianthor and take their proper place at the top.  The Son thinks that their leader Nikos Pamboridis gets some of his intel from someone that the Sons don&amp;#39;t know about.  Ruan gives the severed finger back to its owner, as if he is mocking or emphasizing its loss, which terrifies the Son more than anything else.  The other Sons basically confirm all this, and reveal their horses are picketed about 500 yards away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCs decide to kill all the Sons and disappear their bodies and their dogs.  Bersaba flies up out of the maple forest, where she sees that the maple holding Saphira&amp;#39;s temple is over 3000 feet tall and its branches spread over 1500 feet wide!  She flies around looking for a lake they can dump the bodies in and finds one, where a rocky valley was blocked by a landslide and filled with water.  When she returns Locryn uses the Beast Tongue spell to promise the horses freedom and food if they overcome their natural dislike of the smell of blood and carry the bodies of the Sons and their dogs to the lake.  The horses agree.  The PCs load the bodies and head off for the lake, about 4 hours away, leading the horses.  On the way they pass through a valley with good grazing and the horses say this would be a fine place to eat after their chore is finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching the lake the rest of the PCs are surprised and a little worried when they find out Morwen knows all the best tricks for disposing of bodies in lakes — slash the bellies and stuff them full of rocks — as if she has done this before!  They release the horses before starting the bloody work, and the horses immediately head back over the trail to their grazing.  They keep some crossbows and all the remaining bolts, pry the gems out of the hilts of a number of the swords, and toss the bodies, still wearing their armor, the swords, and the horses tack into the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was dark now, so they made camp for the night away from their body dump and washed off the signs of their grisly deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was mostly finishing a combat from the last session, since we spent time beforehand spending character points and updating characters.  The PCs murdered many of a group of various second and succeeding sons of various noble houses who ambushed them because the PCs oppose their evil plan to take over, and killed their HUGE, VICIOUS DOGS TOO...  Next session they plan to interrogate the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-22 15:34:00-05:00 - Mini Six Middle Sea Game, session 5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIMEWARP: This entry brought to you by the power of TIME TRAVEL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was another online game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen misty green female figures materialize from the surface of the pool on the lower level and wail!  Locryn runs away.  Iria, made of sterner stuff, tries to stay and explain the PCs mean no harm, but one of the figures floats over to her and attacks her psychically, almost incapacitating her!  She runs away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for Iria to recover one of the characters mentions that they had noticed that one of the ghostly green figures was wearing an amulet.  Thinking of the medallions they had discovered earlier they put them on and go back downstairs.  The misty figures do not appear, and they continue exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Ruan and Bersaba accidently set a table in an alchemy lab on fire and are badly burned they discover the pool on this level is also full of healing water.  They interact with several items which give them various feelings.  They find a staff carved as if it was a woman stretched disturbingly thin, which gave them feelings of dread.  Iria foolishly put the staff in the pool, which resulted in an explosion, and clouds of steam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They find another secret door, leading to a steep stair going down into a room with a carving of Saphira on the north wall and an altar.  They chant the ritual and summon the oracle and the carving of Saphira comes to life, and after convincing her that their aims were true, she reveals they can find the Hammer of Torgoth in the tomb of the Sorcerer-Smith Torgoth, located on Mount Wasarey in the Presaris Mountains, about a week&amp;#39;s travel west from Korianthor, and says “Only the hammer of Torgoth can silence the Eye of Zetha.  Beware the touch of the eye, since the evil is greater since the passing of Alekos Vasiliou.”  Each of the characters is gifted with two small gourds with stoppers, and told “These will help you when you are wounded.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they leave the temple, they are ambushed by well armed and dressed men and a pack of huge, fierce mastiff, also wearing armor!  These must be some of the Sanguine Sons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;http://consp.org/blog/2023/sanguine-sons-ambush.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ambush!&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCs are stuck in the entryway of the temple, menaced by mastiffs close at hand, while the Sanguine Sons attack with crossbows from a distance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-15 23:03-05:00 - Mini Six Middle Sea Game, session 4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to run another session today of the Middle Sea Mini Six game I&amp;#39;ve been running for the kids, the fourth session, online.  They&amp;#39;ve been taking an in-depth approach, so it&amp;#39;s taking more time that I anticipated, in an enjoyable way.  They travelled to the Votlem Range seeking the abandoned temple of Saphira, getting directions in a remote village.  Along the way they see an albino stag and end up fighting the wolves that were following it.  The next day they see the stag again, and it leads them more directly to the temple than their previous instructions would have taken them.   The temple is in a maple tree that is over 100 feet in diameter!  They figure out how to open the temple doors and explored it, finding a pool of healing water, a mysterious bumble bee, a room with remains of ritual robes and some silver medallions, secret passages, a throne with a secret compartment containing a book telling how to invoke the oracle, and a stairway to a deeper level, where they started to explore further but all but Locryn and Iria were driven back to the upper level by frightening misty green apparitions of women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TIMEWARP: This entry brought to you by the power of TIME TRAVEL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a hiatus of 1 year and 195 days I got to run another session of the Mini Six Middle Sea game I&amp;#39;m running for the “kids”, face to face!  (They&amp;#39;re all grown, but I still call them that.)  Anyway, this time they continued following up information about the prophecy by being introduced by Maeloc to Nessa Vivyan, who looks at the scroll and tells them the it prophesies that the Eye of Zetha, a relic of the ancient malevolent goddess Zetha, will once again lead the land into darkness, unless someone uses the Hammer of Torgoth to defeat the Eye of Zetha, and says that the references to an oracle that rests beneath the boughs of of a maple tree probably refers to the temple of Saphira, an ancient goddess of harvest and growth, whose long abandoned temple is in a huge maple tree in a valley in the dangerous Votlem Range a week&amp;#39;s travel south east of Korianthor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they investigating the Sanguine Sons and their leader Nikos Pamboridis and their involvement in the prophecy.  They surveil Nikos&amp;#39;s house, and discover that while normal visitors come to the front door a bunch of very unsavory, criminal looking, folks come to the back door.  Investigating leads them to the headquarters of what turns out to be the headquarters of a criminal gang, the Ravens, who have been gaining influence.  In the process of figuring this out they trade their promise to Cyprien Glafcou, the leader of another gang, to help that gang break into a hard target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their way back to their lodgings they are ambushed by thugs, and murder them all easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2021-06-11 16:23:00-05:00 - Mini Six Middle Sea Game, session 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day they split up to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anaoc, Brannok, Morwen, and Treave went to the First Pepper, to listen to the political discussion.  Anaoc noticed some people seem to be conspiring, more than one group.  Treave talked to several people and figures out there are at least four different known conspiracies, with one of them a conspiracy of a demagogue, a bunch of nobles, and surprising, perhaps a criminal gang.  Anaoc used ESP on someone (Vaso Anastillis) and found out the Sanguine Sons are group of young, discontent, second-son or succeeding (only the first born inherits) noble scion who are supporting unpleasant political figures and are intimidating, beating, and murdering their opponents.  Nikos Pamboridis is a noble, and Vaso thinks of someone he knew who was  beaten to death when the PCs asked about him, but only said he lives by himself in small but impressive house near the house of his family, which is lead by Fotis Pamboridis.  Treave asked about the blood symbol and Vaso said there is a group murdering people and leaving three stylized blood drops on a scrap of parchment on the bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryd, Locryn, Greeth, and Bersaba went to the forum to find out about the scroll and Nessa.  Locryn found a scholar, Maeloc Minear, who is knowledgeable about languages, and treated him to drinks at the Friendly Owl, a scholar&amp;#39;s bar (tea &amp;amp; herbal infusions).  He told the PCs a little about the scroll, and turned out to have a friend Nessa Vivyan (**!**) who could tell them more.  The PCs speculated that this is the Nessa of the note, and told Maeloc of the assassin and suggested that Nessa may also be in danger.  Maeloc decided to accompany them to visit Nessa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is mid-afternoon.  The PCs are split up, and haven&amp;#39;t gone anywhere yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where it ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIMEWARP: This entry brought to you by the power of TIME TRAVEL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCs stayed at a coaching in on the way to Korianthor, the Jewel of the Southern Continent. The PCs woke in the middle of the night to screaming and found another patron just being killed by an assassin. The PCs captured the assassin and Anaoc Rosewarne interrogated him using ESP.  He turned out to be Mairi Vitalelli, sent by a wealthy noble with a smirk, associated in his mind somehow with three blood drops, and seeking a scroll case.  Searching him they found a note signed NP (probably Nikos Pamboridis; see ESP!) with three stylized blood drops telling him where and when and who.  The PCs searched, and found the scroll cached above a loose board in the ceiling.  The scroll was covered in glyphs that nobody can read, but the scroll case has a note as well — “My dear fellow, can you have found it at last?  Bring it to me in Korianthor and we will see if there is any way to escape the prophecy! — Nessa”.  There is a quick trial and Mairi was hung with a short drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They arrived in Korianthor during the Festival of Masks (like Mardi Gras or Carnival in Venice), when plain masks are worn during the day and elaborite masks are worn at night.  Everybody bought two masks.  They found lodging at The Green Dragon, then went to the forum to enjoy the Festival, observed a gang of thieves at work there.  Ryd approached the leader of the gang, Cyprien Glafcou, and impressed him and found out Nikos Pamboridis was of a “political persuasion” and gave the name of the tavern which he said attracted like souls.  In the forum they met Treave Carwithin, Bersaba Kitto, Morwen Polglaze, and Locryn Treglown, and suggested they also stay at the Green Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
