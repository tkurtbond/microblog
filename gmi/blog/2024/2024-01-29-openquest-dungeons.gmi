My copy of OpenQuest Dungeons arrived yesterday.

The current version of OpenQuest is probably a little more stripped down than I prefer for my D100 systems, but it's a good system, of the Mongoose RuneQuest lineage.  OpenQuest Dungeons is designed to ease a DM and players of “The World's Favorite Fantasy Game” to the different pace and approach of dungeons in a D100 game.  It contains a general introduction to OpenQuest for those used to the other games dungeons, some stock NPCs, a list of 26 traps expressed in OpenQuest mechanics, and three short dungeons.  The adventures made me want to run them, so that's a plus.
