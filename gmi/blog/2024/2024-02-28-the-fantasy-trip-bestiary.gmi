I downloaded the PDF of The Fantasy Trip Bestiary today.  After a quick scan up to page 79 I like what what I've seen.  Lots of natural animals and unnatural creatures.  TFT stat blocks are tiny (4 stats, armor, attacks, and special abilities), so seeing that each  generally has up to a page or more of information, including a description of the creature and sections labeled "Habitat", "Behavior", "Natural Enemies", and "Economic and Cultural Significance" is wonderful, with lots of things to spark ideas

More details when the physical book arrives.
