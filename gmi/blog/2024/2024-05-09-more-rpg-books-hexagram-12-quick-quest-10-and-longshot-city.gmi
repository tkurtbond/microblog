These were all the physical results of Kickstarters.  I read both Hexagram #12 and Quick Quest 10, and both are good, although I have to wonder if there is an effective way to deal with one of the creatures in the Quick Quest other than “Run away”?  It still looks fun.

I have not had time to read Longshot City, a superhero RPG with a system inspired by Troika, but I'm looking forward to it.
