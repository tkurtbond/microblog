# 2024-06-13 20:05:05-04:00 - The Fantasy Trip Bestiary Finished

I finished reading The Fantasy Trip Bestiary today.  All in all, I'm very pleased by the content.  It was interesting to see how many real animals they included; all had points of interest, and I can see using them in the game.  I wish they had been more consistent about some of the information they included that: for instance, why give breeding information for the pegasus, and explicitly note that breeding information on unicorns is not available, but not give breeding information for the hypogriff, which is only found among humans?  And it would have been nice to have weights for the fantasy creatures â€” PCs often want to carry off parts or entire corpses.  But these are minor quibbles. It's definitely a useful book for an TFT GM.
