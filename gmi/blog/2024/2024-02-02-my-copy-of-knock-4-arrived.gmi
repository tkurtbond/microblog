The inside of the dust jacket is an adventure inspired by the module B4 The Lost City, The Lost City Sandbox.  There are locations, a perspective map, location descriptions, lists of appropriate names, and several useful random tables including encounters outside the city, two tables for random buildings (random rooms in buildings, random occupants of rooms), a table of random rumors, random drugs, and a master table with events, outsiders, citizens, factions, atmosphere, and lucky finds.

That's just the inside of the dust jacket!
