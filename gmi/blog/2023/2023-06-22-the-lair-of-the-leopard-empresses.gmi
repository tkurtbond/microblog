My copy of The Lair of the Leopard Empresses came two days ago, and I have really enjoying reading it.  It is based on the Monsters! Monsters! rules, which are basically the Tunnels & Trolls rules, and is a great example of how to use those rules and how to add to them in a way that makes the best use of the existing rules.  It also presents an interesting setting.  I'll write more on my regular blog, since it's likely to be a long article and will take some more time.
