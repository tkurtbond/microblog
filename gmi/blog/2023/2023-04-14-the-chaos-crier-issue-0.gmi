# 2023-04-14 20:41:48-04:00 - The Chaos Crier, Issue #0

My copies of Black Sword Hack: Ultimate Chaos Edition and The Chaos Crier, Issue #0 arrived.  Naturally, I read the later first.  It describes a creepy seaside town, the horrible monsters that are subverting it, the cult that foolishly enables it, the town's inhabitants, and those who struggle against the coming apocalypse.  Excellently written, though I take fault with the layout.  Overflowing with great ideas.
