Old School Stylish (OSS) is an interesting zine supplement of 28 pages (counting both covers) for Old School Essentials (OSE).  OSS drops the class system and instead lets characters pick up “styles”, which are small collections of capabilities.  As they adventure they can find and acquire (with suitable effort) more styles.  Everything, from hit points to spells to thief  capabilities to Armour Class, are part of styles.  Characters can have multiple styles active, and can switch out styles for other ones they have learned.  By default characters still have levels, but there is a option for dropping levels as well.  As you might guess from the cover image this zine takes inspiration from martial arts and cultivation media.  OSS offers a lot of ideas for how to acquire styles in play, from petitioning masters to learning a style by observing special circumstances.  It provides several tables to help you come up with interesting ways for characters to learn styles.  It also suggests that the players NOT use the book to select styles for their character, but leave it up to the DM to place styles to be found in the world, which I thought was interesting.
