This was mostly finishing a combat from the last session, since we spent time beforehand spending character points and updating characters.  The PCs murdered many of a group of various second and succeeding sons of various noble houses who ambushed them because the PCs oppose their evil plan to take over, and killed their HUGE, VICIOUS DOGS TOO...  Next session they plan to interrogate the survivors.
