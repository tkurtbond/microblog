Ends of the Earth: A Weird Fantasy Hexcrawl Setting for your Favorite Fantasy RPG by Chris Longhurst is a wonderful zine bursting with ideas.  It is system neutral, but I can see how to easily adapt it for pretty much any fantasy system.  The only things I would change would be to have a thicker cover stock and to have the coordinates (this row of hexes is 1, this diagonal of hexes is A) on the full map on page 4.  Lots of interesting powerful entities, factions, and NPCs.
