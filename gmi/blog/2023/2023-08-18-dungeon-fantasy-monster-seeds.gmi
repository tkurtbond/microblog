I was glad to get my physical copy a while ago.  Having now looked over it, I think it did exactly what it set out to do, gather the various Monster Seeds for the original Dungeon Fantasy Monsters developed and published in various places during the Kickstarter for Dungeon Fantasy 2 in one place, something that hadn't been done before.  So far, so good.

However, I think they missed an opportunity.  As well as gathering the existing Monster Seeds they should have taken the chance to add more.  As it is the book is very small, with very large type.  Adding new monster seeds would have given the book more substance.
