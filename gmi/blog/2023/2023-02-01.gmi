Big Eyes, Small Mouth 4E's Dimension Walk Attribute is EXACTLY Shadow Shifting from Zelazny's Amber Chronicles!

Squee!

When I read the Dimension Walk attribute description a character concept came into my head and I HAD to write it down!

Oh, looking back I see it first showed up in BESM 3E.  Still, neat!
