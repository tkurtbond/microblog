So, the BESM 4E game I was playing in came to an unexpected stop, alas.  It looked like it might be replaced with OVA: The Anime Role-Playing Game, but in the end we couldn't agree on an anime setting to play in, and we ended up playing Deathbringer instead.

The Deathbringer game we played was fun, but I regret not getting to play OVA.  So now I'm rereading OVA and wishing I had the time and a game to play in.
