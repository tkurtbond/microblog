I finished L. Sprague de Camp's "The Fallible Fiend" on the 27th, and Lin Carter's "Down to a Sunless Sea" on the 28th, and I've been reflecting on the impression that each book gives of its author.  When I read de Camp I get the sense of a very smart man enjoying showing how smart he is.  When I read Lin Carter I get impression of a man who loves fantasy and science fiction and is overjoyed to be sharing them with his friends.
