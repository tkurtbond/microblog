If you have virtual workspaces on macOS and you use the emacs function display-pixel-width it will give the combined with of ALL the monitors you are using.  You are better off using (caddr (frame-monitor-attribute 'geometry)), since frame-monitor-attribute gets the specified attribute from the monitor which the current frame is actually on.  BTW: The function frame-monitor-attributes returns all the monitor attributes.  The function display-monitor-attributes-list returns the attributes for ALL the monitors you are using.

I figured this out when I was debugging a couple of emacs functions to move the current frame left or right on the screen.
