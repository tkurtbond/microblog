I finally got around to downloading the Adventurer, Conqueror, King System, Imperial Imprint (ACKS II) PDFs from the Kickstarter, and I have been very pleased with what I found on a quick scan.

I've started reading the ACKS II Revised Rulebook in detail, am about â…• of the way through (it's a massive tome of over 500 pages), and am impressed with the production values (as I expected after seeing Autarch's By This Axe), the clarity of the writing, and the system design.  I can't wait until I get the physical books.
