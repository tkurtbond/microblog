# 2025-06-27 14:54:20-04:00 - Still putting along

I haven't had much to say lately, but I'm still putting along.  I'm playing D&D 5E regularly, and occasionally running a Barrowmaze game using Advanced Labyrinth Lord.  My RPG reading is concentrating right now on the HARP Fantasy RPG and it's supplements, but I'm working on some stuff for Big Eyes Small Mouth Second Revised Second Edition (BESM 2ER) and Centauri Knights, and there are other RPG things I'm working on in the background, like (slowly) reading ACKS II.
