I scanned quickly through Wight-Box by The Basic Expert.  It's a retro-clone of Original Dungeons & Dragons, with influences from Chainmail and some of the early Strategic Review issues, and includes some interestingly different approaches compared to other OD&D retro-clones.  It looks well written.  I'll be reading it in more detail later.
