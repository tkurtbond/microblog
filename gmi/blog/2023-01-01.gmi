We've been investigating (and terrifying) smugglers, racing dinosaurs, and engaging in gladitorial combat (though not to the death)!

## 14:23 EST - Cults, Undead, and Ziggurats in Old Port Nyanzaru

After competing in the Arena, we continued looking for fragments of the artificat, being approached to deal with a cult of deranged Grungs, rescue a rescue party trying to retrieve kidnapped citizens, and in the process murdering cultists, sending undead to their final rest, and finding a person of evil magic intent on feeding their undead on us!
