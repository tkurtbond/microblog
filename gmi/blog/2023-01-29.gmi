# 2023-01-29 14:42 EST - Owlbear Rodeo 1.0 will be open-sourced

This is old news, but according to the Owlbear.Rodeo folks, Owlbear.Rodeo 1.0 will eventually be shut down, but it will also be open-sourced.

I've found Owlbear.Rodeo to be an excellent simple virtual table top (VTT), easy to use and low overhead.  Combined with Discord for audio and dice rolling it's a great way to play any RPG that doesn't have a dedicated VTT implementation.  I put the character sheets and campaign notes in Google Drive, and sometimes use a Google Sheets spreadsheet for games with per-character initiative, like the one I use for Mini Six.
