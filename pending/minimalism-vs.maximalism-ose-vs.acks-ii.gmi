Minimalism vs. Maximalism: Old School Essentials vs. Adventurer, Conqueror, King System Imperial Imprint

I run an intermittent Old School Essentials (OSE) Advanced Fantasy game.  And I've played in a couple of Adventurer, Conqueror, King System, first edition (ACKS1E), games. And I backed Adventurer, Conqueror, King Imperial Imprint (ACKS II), and am very satisfied with the resulting books.  Both of these systems are inspired by the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert D&D sets, but they take very different directions.  OSE started as a very faithful retro-clone of B/X, and with the Advanced Fantasy version it adapted the races, classes, spells, magic items, etc., of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, first edition (AD&D1E), to the power level of  B/X, but retained the smaller hit dice and the smaller number of levels.  It is, essentially, another version of B/X D&D.  ACKS1E, on the other hand, was inspired by B/X, having a similar spread of levels, but used related but different mechanics for a number of things: Armor Class starting at 0 for unarmored characters and going up, proficiencies (some of which are like skills, others somewhat like feats) which add additional distinguishing features to characters.
