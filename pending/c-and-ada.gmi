I learned C in college,and Ada at about the same time.  Previously I was familiar with Applesoft BASIC, VAX BASIC, USCD Pascal, OMSI Pascal, VAX Assembly Language, Forth, and perhaps some other languages, but I was most proficient in Pascal and BASIC.  I was probably just starting to learn about Lisp.

I remember how learning C seemed to open up my world to endless possibilities.  At the time, learning Ada was not as notable.  Writing C programs was a flexible process of imagination, discovery, and crashing code.  Writing Ada programs was a lot more thinking up front, and seemed like more work.  Unfortunately, I was too naive to see that the additional work caused by Ada's type system was cutting out even more work debugging that was exacerbated by C's weak type system.
